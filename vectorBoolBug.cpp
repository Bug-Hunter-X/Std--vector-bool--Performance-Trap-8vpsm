std::vector<bool> is not always a good idea. It optimizes for memory usage but this optimization can lead to performance issues because it doesn't store bools as individual bits but as bits within a larger memory block.  Accessing individual elements may become slower than with a std::vector<char> or std::vector<int> where each element is stored at a memory address and readily accessed.  Using std::bitset may provide better performance for large collections of booleans.
